 # Prompt Pilot
 An agent designed to help you build better agents. It leverages a curated collection of sample agent instructions from [Copilot prompt library](https://aka.ms/copilot-prompt-library) to guide the creation of new prompts for declarative agents. This assistant can help you write effective agent instructions, improve existing drafts, and find inspiration from real-world examples.

For instance, if you're creating an agent to summarize documents or automate support tickets, the Prompt pilot can suggest prompt structures and best practices based on similar agents from the sample repository.

Use this agent when:

You're unsure how to begin crafting an agent instruction.

You want to refine or troubleshoot an agent prompt.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run this app template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts).
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)
> - [Microsoft 365 Copilot license](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites#prerequisites)



1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Create app by clicking `Provision` in "Lifecycle" section.
4. Select `Preview in Copilot (Edge)` or `Preview in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
5. Once the Copilot agent is loaded in the browser, click on the "â€¦" menu and select "Copilot chats". You will see your declarative agent on the right rail. Clicking on it will change the experience to showcase the logo and name of your declarative agent.
6. Ask a question to your declarative agent and it should respond based on the instructions provided.

| `m365agents.yml` | This is the main Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit project file. The project file defines two primary things: Properties and configuration Stage definitions. |

## Extend the template

- [Add conversation starters](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=3): Conversation starters are hints that are displayed to the user to demonstrate how they can get started using the declarative agent.
- [Add web content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=4) for the ability to search web information.
- [Add OneDrive and SharePoint content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=5) as grounding knowledge for the agent.
- [Add Microsoft Copilot connectors content](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=6) to ground agent with enterprise knowledge.
- [Add API plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/build-declarative-agents?tabs=ttk&tutorial-step=7) for agent to interact with REST APIs.
